# typewriter

is a npm package for turning Zod schemas into Elm types + decoders.

## quickstart

there is no quickstart

## careful, now

- unions, literals, a handful of other things aren't supported yet but should be soon
- i published this on NPM prematurely so uh, sorry about that
- turns out that figuring out exactly how to slice and dice around shipping an `elm-codegen`-powered thing is less straightforward than i thought
- just subtree this if you need it
